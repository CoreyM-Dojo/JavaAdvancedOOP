>> Goals
- Create an abstract class for classes to inherit from
- Create 3 classes that inherit from the abstract class
- create an interface
- have classes inherit from that interface if it applies

>> Abstract classes
- Cannot be instantiated
- can have constructors
- Classes can only inherit from one parent

>> Interfaces
- Cannot be instantiated
- Cannot have constructors
- Can only have static or final variables meaning they require values
- Instructions to follow for all classes that implement them
